# July 21st, 2024: Initial Design and Electronics Sketch

Started the project by sketching out the electronics layout and taking measurements for the rotating platforms system.

![Measurements and Scale](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa75952e-ce2e-450e-aec3-98b3bccbb663)
took measurments and extruded to scale. The L298n H bridge has space for its these thingies

For the wheels, I'll extrude a circle in the middle of one of them for the cat

Also if I don't it might spin off :(

My mistake was in the assumption that the cat is small enough for the plate. I must first scale it down.  
I took the two furtheest points.

just to save room for error, ill round to 80. The diameter of my playform is 58.53149. The scale factor is 58.53149/80.

now, I made the middle peg based off this hole
