# July 21st, 2024: Initial Design and Electronics Sketch

Started the project by sketching out the electronics layout and taking measurements for the rotating platforms system.

# July 22nd, 2024: Platform Assembly and Scaling

Worked on the rotating platforms assembly and discovered a scaling issue that needed to be addressed.

My mistake was in the assumption that the cat is small enough for the plate. I must first scale it down. I took the two furthest points.

![Scaling Calculation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e129c70c-1aaa-4ce5-83b6-1772885bc56f)
*Scaling calculation - just to save room for error, I'll round to 80. The diameter of my platform is 58.53149. The scale factor is 58.53149/80.*

*Seems to fit perfectly :D*

Now, I made the middle peg based off this hole:
