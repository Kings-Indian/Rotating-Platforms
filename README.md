# Rotating Platforms Project

## Project Description
This project creates a mechanical rotating platform system designed to provide controlled rotational movement. The system consists of multiple platforms that can rotate independently or in coordination, powered by motor-driven mechanisms with precise control through an L298N H-bridge motor driver.

## Why I Made This Project
I wanted to create a mechanical system that demonstrates controlled rotational movement with multiple platforms. This project serves as both a learning experience in mechanical design and motor control, as well as a foundation for more complex rotating systems. The ability to control multiple rotating platforms opens up possibilities for various applications in robotics, automation, and educational demonstrations.
