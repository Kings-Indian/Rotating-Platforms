# Rotating Platforms Project

## Project Description
This project creates a mechanical rotating platform system designed to provide funni rotational movement. The system consists of multiple platforms that can rotate independently or in coordination, powered by motor-driven mechanisms with control through an L298N H-bridge motor driver.

## Why I Made This Project
I wanted to create a mechanical system that demonstrates controlled rotational movement with multiple platforms. This allows me to rotate funni oiia oiia cat and anything else I want, including 2 oiia oiia cats.
