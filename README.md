# Rotating Platforms Project

## Project Description
This project creates a mechanical rotating platform system designed to provide  rotational movement for funni cat spinning and any other thing that I could showcase.. The system consists of multiple platforms that can rotate independently or in coordination, powered by motor-driven mechanisms with control through an L298N H-bridge motor driver and ESP32 microcontroller. The system is powered by a portable 7.2V NiMH battery pack for wireless operation.

## Why I Made This Project
I wanted to create a platform that would spin funni cat. Also, whats better then one cat? 2 cat! I also wanted the option to add other stuff for example my Benchys.
